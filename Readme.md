# Introduction

ninESP is a modular firmware for ESP8266 SoC based on SmingFramework.

It is designed to work with a few kinds of different sensors which you can attach to it
and then acts as an MQTT Client which serves you telemetry data or let you control things. 
So you can easily switch relays or simply as a relay server for RC Plugs 
(All RCSwitch compatible Plugs and Protocols) or just a timer based MQTT publish of sensor values. 
You can find all currently supported modules/sensors below in the "Peripheral Modules" section.

Also it can start an UDP Server and Serial Console to act/react for most of the peripherals, 
you can find a protocol description is down below.


Everything should be accessible and especially configurable from a simple webinterface.
The Webinterface based on the NetworkConfig Example of the SmingFramework.

On first run it starts a Wifi Accesspoint from itself with name *"ninHome Configuration"*
which you can connect from any Wifi enabled device and then connect with a webbrowser
to "http://192.168.4.1" to get into the webinterface.
There you can first configure the Wifi it should connect to, the mqtt settings and the 
connected periphals and the corresponding mqtt topics.
After you configured your ninESP you can find the current IP Address on the defined LWT MQTT 
Topic when the client is online, if it disconnects it will just say "Offline" in the LWT Topic.

In Version 0.2 the library for the MAX7219 control changed to a more modern and flexible
library which can do a lot of more animations. 
MD_MAX72xx and MD_Parola which are from [MajicDesigns](https://github.com/MajicDesigns) 
Since this version (0.2) your flash size has to be at least a 1M type. 

The firmware itself should be mostly compatible to the closed source firmware for the
inwall esp8266 which you can find and buy on ebay.

You can find the latest firmware version in a binary format in the firmware folder in the root of this repository

Also there is a [project description on hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/28555-esp8266-max7219-dot-matrix-display-as-mqtt-client/)  about the MAX72xx Module in the ninESP

# Known Working Boards/Chips

Here you find a list of development boards and modules which are known to work with ninESP firmware.
ESP-201 Modules will work but some of them are only manufactured with an 512k flash so it is too small
for the ninESP firmware.

# Dependencies

The project relies on SmingFramework for ESP8266, the SmingFramework is as submodule added but not the 
[esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) , which you had to install also and by yourself.
As other submodules are the libraries of MajicDesigns included.
[MD_MAX72xx](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_MAX72XX) - MAX72xx Driver Library
[MD_Parola](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_Parola) - Animation Library for MAX72XX

~~It uses a slightly modified version of the SmingFramework MQTTClient Class, cause i needed
some small additions to that.~~

# How to use

If ninESP is configured correctly and is connected to your defined MQTT broker, you can send/receive data on the specified topics for the periphery you want to control,

Examples with mosquitto client:

#####MAX72XX Module:

In the examples we use a topic prefix of "client/display/"

Send a new text "Hello World" to Display with topic "client/display/text"
```mosquitto_pub -h YOURMQTTBROKER -u MQTTUSER -P MQTTPASS -r -t client/display/text -m "Hello World"```

Enable inverting of the Display with topic "client/display/invert"
```mosquitto_pub -h YOURMQTTBROKER -u MQTTUSER -P MQTTPASS -r -t client/display/invert -m 1```

#####Relay Module:

Switch relay to ON state on topic "client/relay"
```mosquitto_pub -h YOURMQTTBROKER -u MQTTUSER -P MQTTPASS -r -t client/relay -m 1```

#####RCSwitch Module:

In the examples we use a topic prefix of "client/rcswitch/"

Switch Plug 1 to OFF state on topic "client/rcswitch/1"
```mosquitto_pub -h YOURMQTTBROKER -u MQTTUSER -P MQTTPASS -r -t client/rcswitch/1 -m 0```

You can use any mqtt client to interact with ninESP, for example an mobile android mqtt client is 
[MQTT Dash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.routix.mqttdash)

# Flashing to your board

If you just want to flash the firmware without the compiling, you can take one of our binary releases from the firmware folder in the repository. 
There are zip archives with the firmware files in it. 
Its not one file builds so you have to flash it seperately. The flash addresses are the file names of the binaries.
Except of the spiff rom, which had to be in this case on memory address *0x5A000*. 
An example flashing command with esptool could look like this.

```esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 230400 write_flash -ff 40m -fm qio -fs 32m 0x00000 0x00000.bin 0xa000 0xa000.bin 0x5A000 spiff_rom.bin```

# FAQ

*Q. My MAX7219 Displays are mirrored or just displaying crap, what can i do?*
A. Look in the MAX72XX Submodule folder and open the MAX72xx.h in edit mode and
    search for the MAX7219 module settings. There you can change the type of module you got
    and will hopefully fix the displaying issue.
    
*Q. The firmware want compile, it says "error: 'typedef' was ignored in this declaration"*
A. Apply the MD_Parola.patch from the repositorys root folder.
Or remove the "typedef" tag from MD_Parola.h by yourself

*Q. Can i see or download the configuration files for later use?*
A. You can see or download the configuration files in json format if you open
http://YOUR_ESP_IP/dumpcfg?type=TYPE 
and TYPE can be *mqtt*, *network* or *periph*
